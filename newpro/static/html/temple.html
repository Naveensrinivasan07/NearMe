The Kamatchi Amman Temple is an ancient Hindu Temple dedicated to the goddess Kamakshi,
one of the highest aspects of Adi Shakti in Shaktism. It is located in the historic city of Kanchipuram,
near Chennai, India. Its construction is credited to the Pallava kings, whose capital was in the same city.
This temple, along with the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai and the Akilandeswari temple in Thiruvanaikaval 
near Tiruchirappalli are the important centers of Goddess worship in the state of Tamil Nadu
